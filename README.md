## Image Component Analyzer

This Streamlit application enables users to upload an image and receive a list of detected components. It utilizes computer vision techniques to identify objects within the image.

### Usage

Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: Use the provided widget to upload an image (supported formats include JPEG, PNG, etc.).

2. **Analyze Image**: Click the "Analyze Image" button to trigger the analysis process.

3. **Results Display**: The app will display a list of detected components (e.g., "cat," "tree," "car") based on the image content.

### Customization

Feel free to customize the app by adding more sophisticated image analysis models or improving the UI. You can also enhance the component detection accuracy by fine-tuning the underlying model.
